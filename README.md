# Towards Temporal Event Detection: A Dataset, Benchmarks and Challenges

This is to introduce a collection of a fully-labelled temporal event dataset(TED) annotated with verifiable real-world event names, which can support detecting events in multiple patterns from forecasting data streams, such as ended events, no-show events, and long-lasting events, etc. TED includes 11,589 videos shared from 2006 to 2022, being annotated to 1,164 real-world events. The event categories cover a wide range of topics, including public security, natural disasters, elections, sports and entertainment.

The codes can be shared to download the news articles and social media posts upon request for non-commercial use.
